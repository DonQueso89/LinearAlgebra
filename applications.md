## Applications of linear systems

### A homogeneous linear system in economics.

**A homogeneous linear system is a consistent system that can be written as Ax = 0**

with A ∈ Rmxn, x ∈ Rn and 0 is the zero vector of size n

Leontief showed that if: - we know the total price of output of each sector - we know the distribution of each sector to other sectors

We can assign prices so that each sectors expenses match their profit by
solving a linear system.

### Network flow

Systems of linear equations tend to arise naturally when observing the flow of some quantity through a network
